# Mult-Function-Calculator
This is my second project in my journey to learning python

First, put in the operation you want to use. You can choose between addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.(just make sure to spell it right) then press enter.

Second, input your first number. If you are using division then the first number should be the dividend(number your going to divide) and if you are using subtraction the first number should be minuend.

After that, it will tell you what the sum, difference, product, or quotient of the two numbers are.
